# 100_Days_of_ML_Code
I will write code here related to Machine Learning Algorithms.

Some basic ML algo:

  For classification
  
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. SVM classification
    3. Decision Tree
    4. Random Forests
    5. Naive Bayes
    6. K nearest neighbour

    
  For Regression
   1. Linear Regression
   2. SVM Regression
   3. DT Regression
   4. RF Regression
